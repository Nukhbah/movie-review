Modelâ€™s Performance
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this sentiment analysis project, I evaluated two machine learning models
*	Naive Bayes
*	Logistic Regression
on the IMDB movie reviews dataset to classify reviews as either positive or negative.

Naive Bayes Model: The Naive Bayes model, known for its simplicity, achieved an accuracy 
of about 86% on the test data. It performed well, with balanced precision and recall across 
both classes.

Logistic Regression Model: The Logistic Regression model outperformed Naive Bayes with an 
accuracy of 89.04%. It showed better performance on both positive and negative reviews, 
with higher precision and recall, leading to a more balanced and accurate classification.

The Logistic Regression model proved to be more effective overall, delivering better 
accuracy and more balanced performance. While both models performed well, 
I found Logistic Regression to be the preferred choice due to its superior results.
